# DeepPurpose
Codes for in silico reasearch of drugs.

DeepPurpose was created by Kexin Huang at the University of Harvard to use 3 pretrained models of proteins to predict the interaction of a protein and a drug. 
Find more information about it in his scientific research at  https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/22-23/5545/6020256.
You can use this Jupyter locally or in a new Gradio app for 72 hours.

It also contained other tools for molecular docking: e.g. Swissdock and other deep learning tools for drug research: docktring, ADMETLab3, QSAR and others.
